Clustering in R
https://rpubs.com/saqib/DocumentClustering

Different term weights
tf*idf (term frequency x inverse document frequency)
tf: Terms that are frequent in a document represent its meaning well
idf: Terms that are rare in the corpus distinguish among documents well

Types of Clustering Algorithms

Hard (Exclusive)
Each object is in just one cluster.
The most common type of clustering.

Soft (Not exclusive)
Each object has degrees of membership in a cluster
Less common

Flat Clustering K-Means:
Algorithm
- Randomly pick K objects to define cluster centroids (centers)
  While (Not Done)
  	Assign each object to the cluster with the nearest centroid
  	Calculate new cluster centroids for each cluster

Typical Stopping Criteria
- N passes, e.g., N=5
- Stable centroids
	- E.g., they don't change much from iteration i to i+1

Characteristics
- No guidance about how to choose the right value for K
- Can be sensitive to the initial choice of centroids
- Clusters defined by centers of mass
- Hard clustering
- Simple and fast
	- Computational complexity is O(n)
- Very popular

Before clustering, shouldn't we standardize (clean) our descriptions?
